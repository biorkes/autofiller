# Autofiller
Autofiller is a simple jQuery script that fills in form inputs based on the key=value pairs from the URL.

Autofiller takes the form_id query as a main from element which holds all the inputs you need to fill in.
While iterrating the form childrens, the script tries to find a matching key = inputName pair and when it finds one it takes the value from the URL and places it as a value to the matched input.
